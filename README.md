# time_keep

The application you built using Flutter incorporates various features to manage tasks efficiently. It utilizes Sqflite for local data storage and implements the Bloc pattern to handle state management. The application consists of three main sections: Tasks, Done, and Archived.

Tasks Section:
In this section, users can add new tasks to their to-do list. Each task includes a title, description, and a start time for the task. Users can set the date and time for the task to start, helping them plan and organize their schedule effectively. The Tasks section serves as the primary workspace for users to manage their pending tasks.

Done Section:
The Done section displays a list of tasks that users have marked as completed. When users finish a task, they can move it from the Tasks section to the Done section. This allows users to keep track of completed tasks and review their accomplishments.

Archived Section:
The Archived section stores tasks that users no longer need in their active to-do list. Users can choose to archive tasks that are no longer relevant or needed for the present time. Archiving tasks helps users maintain a clutter-free task list while still preserving important information for future reference.

Task Deletion:
In both the Done and Archived sections, users have the option to delete tasks permanently. Deleting tasks allows users to remove unnecessary entries and keep the task list tidy.
